## Main Workflow

1. The user is prompted to enter their email address.
2. User financial data is retrieved from the database, including income and expenses.
3. A spending summary is generated using the Gemini API.
4. Monthly and categorized spending charts are created as PDF files.
5. The data is saved to an Excel file.
6. The email is prepared with the summary and attached files.
7. The email is sent to the user.

## Variables

- **smtp_port**: The standard secure SMTP port (587).
- **smtp_server**: The Google SMTP server ("smtp.gmail.com").
- **email_from**: The sender's email address (DollarBot's email).
- **pswd**: The application password used to authenticate with Gmail.
- **msg**: The MIME multipart object to define email parts.
- **attachments**: A list of paths to the files to be attached.
- **TIE_server**: The SMTP server connection used for sending the email.

## Dependencies

The script relies on several libraries:
- `smtplib`: For sending emails using SMTP.
- `email.mime`: For creating email messages with attachments.
- `pandas`: For handling data in a DataFrame format.
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations of financial data.
- `extract`: A module for data extraction functionalities.
- `helper`: A module for user data retrieval.
- `gemini_helper`: A module for interacting with the Gemini API to generate summaries.

## Usage

1. Run the script. The bot will prompt the user to enter their email address.
2. The script retrieves user financial data and generates the spending summary and charts.
3. The generated charts and summary are sent as attachments to the provided email address.

**Important**: Ensure that the Gmail account is properly set up and that an application-specific password is created before using this script.

## Testing

The script includes logging to monitor the status of email sending and error handling to capture issues during execution.
